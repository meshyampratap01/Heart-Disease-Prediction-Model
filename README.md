💓 Heart Disease Prediction Model
This project is a Machine Learning-based Heart Disease Prediction System that helps predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on key medical attributes. Built using Python, this model uses popular ML libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy, and applies classification algorithms to predict heart disease with high accuracy.

🔍 Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early diagnosis can significantly reduce risks and improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to leverage data-driven techniques to provide a fast, reliable, and cost-effective method for early heart disease prediction.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available Heart Disease UCI dataset, containing patient records with 13 key features such as:

Age

Sex

Chest Pain Type (cp)

Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)

Serum Cholesterol (chol)

Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)

Resting ECG Results (restecg)

Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)

Exercise-Induced Angina (exang)

ST Depression (oldpeak)

Slope of the ST Segment (slope)

Number of Major Vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

🤖 Machine Learning
The project includes:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Training: Multiple classification models were tested, including:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.

✅ Key Features
Clean and modular Python code.

Well-commented Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding.

Visualizations for data insights.

High-performance model with comparative evaluation.

Ready for deployment and integration with web apps.
